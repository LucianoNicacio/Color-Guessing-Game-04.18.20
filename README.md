# Color-Guessing-Game-04.18.20
Nucamp Bootcamp Project. As a team effort, built a color-guessing game using basic JavaScript, including functions, 
variables, arrays, operators, if statements, do ... while loops.  
It was a good practice to apply what we had learned about arrays and generating random numbers, using Math.random() and Math.floor().
